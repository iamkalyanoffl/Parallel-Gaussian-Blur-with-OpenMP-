# Parallel-Gaussian-Blur-with-OpenMP-
This repository contains a project implementing a parallelized Gaussian Blur algorithm using OpenMP as part of the Computer Architecture and Organisation (CAO) course (BCSE205L). 

Parallel programming is essential in modern computing for performance  improvements. OpenMP is one of the most widely used frameworks for  parallel programming. This project discusses the parallelization of Gaussian Blur Algorithm using OpenMP.  

Gaussian Blur is a convolution image processing technique used as a preprocessing stage of many computer vision algorithms used for smoothing an image by blending pixel values based on a Gaussian function, thus 
effectively reducing noise and detail.
